Create a small Overwolf app that will interact with the different stages of League of Legends and use the multi overwolf-window flow we use in MobaBeast apps.

Open with LoL. Close / Minimize at all time + with hotkey
Background window logic?
Desktop window = Summoner name + 'In champ select' + Game finished (in stats)
IG Window = Game loading... + Game in progress...
Able to do that over and over
